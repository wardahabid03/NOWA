According to a survey by World Food Programme (WWF), 2.8 billion tons of food 
is wasted globally which ultimately results in hunger and poverty. In order to 
lessen the effects of hunger, NOWA (NO WASTE) aims of providing an online platform to
offer free meals to those who are struggling with it. It enables a collaboration 
among business owners (owners of bakeries and restaurants), reputable NGOs (who look 
for communities and individuals in need of us), and individuals (who may either know 
someone in need of food or the deserving area where food is needed). Each sort of user
has an account that has been set up once all the information has been confirmed/authenticated.

The first two users can modify the status by controlling a table that lists the name of
the company, its location, the type and name of food it is currently serving, and its
availability. All other users may view the table so that they are aware of the system and are able to evaluate its legitimacy.
